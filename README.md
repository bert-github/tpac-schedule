# tpac-schedule

An entry for the TPAC 2025 hackathon.

This is the system that builds the TPAC schedule page.
It includes programs (in Bash and Awk) to retrieve entries from the W3C group calendar, 
convert the entries from iCalendar to HTML fragments, sort them and put them in an HTML page.
The page provides a list view and a grid view (by means of CSS)
and the list views can be sorted in different ways (with JavaScript).

In other words: a nightmare :-) But several people manage to use the system nevertheless.
